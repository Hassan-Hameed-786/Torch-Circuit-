# Torch-Circuit-
This project is a compact torch circuit designed in EasyEDA. It uses a CR2032 coin cell, a push-button switch, current-limiting resistors, and three LEDs. The schematic, PCB layout, and 3D model were created to demonstrate basic circuit design, PCB routing, and component placement skills.
