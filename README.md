Torch PCB Project (EasyEDA)

This project is a simple torch (LED light) circuit designed using EasyEDA. It demonstrates the complete workflow of electronic design, including schematic creation, PCB layout, and 3D visualization.

The circuit is powered by a CR2032 coin cell and uses a push-button switch to control three LEDs. Each LED is connected through a current-limiting resistor to ensure safe operation. The PCB layout is compact and suitable for beginner-level hardware projects.
