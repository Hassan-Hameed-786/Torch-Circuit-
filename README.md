##  Torch PCB Circuit (CR2032 Based)

This project is a **simple torch (LED light) circuit** designed using **EasyEDA**. It is powered by a **CR2032 coin cell battery** and uses a **push-button switch** to control three LEDs. The project is intended for **students and beginners** to understand basic electronics and PCB design.

---

## Project Overview

The torch circuit consists of three LEDs connected in parallel, each with its own **current-limiting resistor** to ensure safe operation. A push-button switch is used to supply power from the coin cell battery to the LEDs.

The complete design includes the **schematic, PCB layout, and 3D PCB model**, demonstrating the full electronic design workflow.

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

- The CR2032 battery supplies power to the circuit  
- Pressing the push button completes the circuit  
- Current flows through resistors to the LEDs  
- LEDs turn ON and produce light  
- Releasing the button turns the LEDs OFF
